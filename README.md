 # Functioning prototype

## Interactive description of the work

#### **Page**: Once the page is loaded, the page will show the original design, with a ‘Play/Pause’ button at the bottom of the canvas.

#### **Play Music**: Move your mouse to the bottom and click this button, the music will start to loop, click the button again to stop the music.

#### **Special Effect**: After the music is played, the coloured spheres on the canvas will zoom in and out according to the frequency and volume of the music, creating a dynamic visual effect.。

## Personal processing
### I chose to add **audio** technology to the group's prototype to demonstrate the perfect blend of music and visuals. In this way, can create a more vivid and interactive piece that allows the audience to hear the music and see the visual changes simultaneously.
