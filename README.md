 # Functioning prototype

## Interactive description of the work

#### **Page**: Once the page is loaded, the page will show the original design, with a ‘Play/Pause’ button at the bottom of the canvas.

#### **Play Music**: Move your mouse to the bottom and click this button, the music will start to loop, click the button again to stop the music.

#### **Special Effect**: After the music is played, the coloured spheres on the canvas will zoom in and out according to the frequency and volume of the music, creating a dynamic visual effect.。

## Personal processing
I chose to add **audio** technology to the group's prototype to demonstrate the perfect blend of music and visuals. In this way, can create a more vivid and interactive piece that allows the audience to hear the music and see the visual changes simultaneously.


## Technology selection and reasons
To make sure that my work was different enough from the rest of the team's, I focused on combining audio with images, while the team members changed the background elements more. Specifically, my design synchronised the sphere with the audio and would change the size and speed of the sphere based on the amplitude value of the music frequency. Through this differentiation, we ensured that each member's work had unique highlights and characteristics and enriched the overall project.
